# Objective

1. How many total types of genres are there?

2. How many total movies are there?

3. Which year had the highest-rated movie, which movie received the highest score, and how many countries had movies with the highest rating?

# Exploratory data analysis(EDA)
Generally, before we go through the EDA process, we must clean the data and choose the right columns for analysis to answer the questions posed by business stakeholders or to meet their requirements.

Here is my dashboard that I used to visualize the dataset and answer the questions.
